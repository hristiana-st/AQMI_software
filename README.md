AQMI - “Assessment of the quality of mammographic images” was developed to support the quality control (QC) of digital mammographic images. The software was implemented in the Python programming language via the Streamlit library, which involved content structuring and environmental planning. AQMI assists in analyzing the image quality test established in IN 92 by the Agência Nacional de Vigilância Sanitária. It also has quality addition indicators, trend graphs, and the image assessment history.  The main goal of AQMI is to optimize and unify the process of performing Image Quality testing for mammography, through an easy-to-use and intuitive user interface.
